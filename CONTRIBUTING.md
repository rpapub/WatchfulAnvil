# Contributing to Watchful Anvil

🎉 Thank you for your interest in contributing! Watchful Anvil is an early-phase initiative to make custom UiPath Workflow Analyzer rules more practical, accessible, and testable—especially in the age of LLM-generated vibe code.

Whether you're fixing a bug, writing a rule, or improving docs, you're helping build something that others can learn from and rely on.

cd WatchfulAnvil
```

Then follow the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/rpapub/WatchfulAnvil/wiki/Getting-Started-Hello-World) in the wiki.


## 💡 Contribution Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
3. Make your changes with clear commits
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch
5. Link to an issue if applicable and follow the PR template
6. Be patient—we review manually and iteratively


## 📏 Code Style & Standards

- Use consistent naming: e.g., `HWR-` prefix for rules
- Follow the `.editorconfig` and `.gitversion.yml`
- Every rule should live in its own class
- If your rule isn't testable, it's probably not mergeable yet

## 🧪 In Progress?

You can still open a **Draft PR**! This helps spark feedback early, even before the code is finished.
